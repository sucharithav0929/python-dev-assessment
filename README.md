# Python Developer Assessment
This repository contains my solutions for the python developer Assessment, where I worked on various small projects to strengthen my Python and Git skills.

**What I worked on:**

- Wrote a simple **Hello World** script to confirm basic functionality.
- Understood the importance of consistent **code style** and used tools like **Black** and **Flake8** to enforce it.
- Learned about the fundamental **Python data structures** and basic algorithm thinking by solving DSA challenges
- Created a **Book class** to practice **OOP concepts** like classes, objects, attributes, and methods in Python.
- Anticipated and handled runtime errors using **Exception Handling** and used **Pycharm** debugger to find logical errors.
- Practiced **debugging and error handling** 
- Fetched and displayed data from a **REST API**

**Skills Highlight**

- Git workflow: branching, merging, and version control  
- Clean Python code and style practices  
- Debugging and exception handling  
- Working with lists, dictionaries, and classes  
- Using REST APIs in Python

**Reflection**

- I found working with APIs most challenging, working with Git is the most fun, and improved a lot on writing structured, readable Python code.
